## Getting started

### Prerequisite

- Python 3.6 or newer

### Installation

Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/OdinMB/semantic-spaces-game.git

Navigate to the game's directory:

    cd semantic-puzzle-game

Install the required Python packages:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Launch the game

    streamlit run Game.py

## Creating new riddles

### Convention

Riddles are stored in the `riddles.txt` file, with one riddle in each line. The first three terms of each line are the ones showing up in the riddle statement. The six following ones are the options that the player can choose from. Terms are separated by ';'.

"Japan is to Germany as sushi is to **\_\_\_\_\_**" is stored like this:

    Japan;Germany;sushi;bratwurst;schnitzel;beer;pretzel;marzipan;autobahn

### Process

**Set up creation mode** (one time)

1. Create a `.env` file with this entry: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key`.
2. Create a `riddles_wip.txt` file.

**Activate creation mode**

3. In the `config.py` file, change `file_name` to `riddles_wip`. This tells the game and the create_embeddings script to refer to the new riddles file.

**Add a new riddle**

4. Enter a riddle into the `riddles_wip.txt` file using the structure summarized above.
5. Run `python create_embeddings_openai.py` to generate a `riddles_wip.npy` file which stores the embeddings for the terms that you included in your riddle (using `text-embedding-ada-002`).
6. Run the game to test your riddle.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until you're happy with the result.
8. Copy the new riddle from `riddles_wip.txt` to `riddles.txt`.

**Wrap-up creation mode**

10. In the `config.py` file, change `file_name` back to `riddles`.
11. Run `python create_embeddings_openai.py` to update the `riddles.npy` file with the new embeddings.

## Deployment

Streamlit needs to be deployed in headless mode. Do one of these:

- Set environment variable `STREAMLIT_SERVER_HEADLESS=true`
- Use a parameter in the start command `streamlit run Game.py --server.headless true`
